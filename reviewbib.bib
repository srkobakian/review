    abstract = { BACKGROUND: To communicate population-based cancer statistics, cancer researchers have a long tradition of presenting data in a spatial representation, or map. Historically, health data were presented in printed atlases in which the map producer selected the content and format. The availability of geographic information systems (GIS) with comprehensive mapping and spatial analysis capability for desktop and Internet mapping has greatly expanded the number of producers and consumers of health maps, including policymakers and the public. Because health maps, particularly ones that show elevated cancer rates, historically have raised public concerns, it is essential that these maps be designed to be accurate, clear, and interpretable for the broad range of users who may view them. This article focuses on designing maps to communicate effectively. It is based on years of research into the use of health maps for communicating among public health researchers. RESULTS: The basics for designing maps that communicate effectively are similar to the basics for any mode of communication. Tasks include deciding on the purpose, knowing the audience and its characteristics, choosing a media suitable for both the purpose and the audience, and finally testing the map design to ensure that it suits the purpose with the intended audience, and communicates accurately and effectively. Special considerations for health maps include ensuring confidentiality and reflecting the uncertainty of small area statistics. Statistical maps need to be based on sound practices and principles developed by the statistical and cartographic communities. CONCLUSION: The biggest challenge is to ensure that maps of health statistics inform without misinforming. Advances in the sciences of cartography, statistics, and visualization of spatial data are constantly expanding the toolkit available to mapmakers to meet this challenge. Asking potential users to answer questions or to talk about what they see is still the best way to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific map design. }

The atlas designs are evaluated on the basis of map design recommendations from cartographers and from a series of cognitive experiments on information extraction from rate maps. Despite some design limitations, the atlases adequately described patterns of U.S. mortality data, resulting in important etiologic findings and action to reduce cancer rates and health disparities."

abstract="Maps demonstrate with a unique efficiency the distribution of phenomena in space. Maps of disease, like other types of map, convey factual information. But, by illustrating disease distributions which either change over short time-periods or vary non-randomly in space, disease maps also inevitably stimulate the formation of causal hypotheses. The earliest examples of disease mapping (medical cartography) were stimulated by the search for clues about the origins of the dreaded infections. Stevenson (1965) draws attention to several spot maps prepared in the context of yellow fever on the eastern seaboard of the United States at the end of the eighteenth century at the time of the debate between contagionists and anticontagionists. Two spot maps (Fig.1) were used by Valentine Seaman in 1798 to illustrate a paper on yellow fever in New York in 1796 and 1797. Twenty-two years later Felix Pascalis-Ouvi{\`e}re (1820) drew a careful spot map to show, yet again, the distribution of cases of yellow fever in New York, in an effort to establish causative factors. A map produced by Cartwright in 1826 of a locality, Natchez, in Mississippi, linked environmental factors closely to an epidemic of the disease. Seaman, Pascalis-Ouvi{\`e}re and Cartwright were anti-contagionists and at that time the map was, in large measure, the weapon of this faction. The extension of the epidemic, as shown on the map, was facilitated, in Cartwright's view, by `a damp climate, an eighty degree (i. e. 27 {\textdegree}C) temperature ... combined with the special effluvia of rotting pork and oysters to envelop the community in a sort of pathogenic mist. The inevitable consequence was widespread yellow fever'. Born largely of experience with yellow fever in the United States and with cholera in Europe disease mapping became relatively commonplace during the subsequent decades.",
