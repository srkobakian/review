    abstract = { BACKGROUND: To communicate population-based cancer statistics, cancer researchers have a long tradition of presenting data in a spatial representation, or map. Historically, health data were presented in printed atlases in which the map producer selected the content and format. The availability of geographic information systems (GIS) with comprehensive mapping and spatial analysis capability for desktop and Internet mapping has greatly expanded the number of producers and consumers of health maps, including policymakers and the public. Because health maps, particularly ones that show elevated cancer rates, historically have raised public concerns, it is essential that these maps be designed to be accurate, clear, and interpretable for the broad range of users who may view them. This article focuses on designing maps to communicate effectively. It is based on years of research into the use of health maps for communicating among public health researchers. RESULTS: The basics for designing maps that communicate effectively are similar to the basics for any mode of communication. Tasks include deciding on the purpose, knowing the audience and its characteristics, choosing a media suitable for both the purpose and the audience, and finally testing the map design to ensure that it suits the purpose with the intended audience, and communicates accurately and effectively. Special considerations for health maps include ensuring confidentiality and reflecting the uncertainty of small area statistics. Statistical maps need to be based on sound practices and principles developed by the statistical and cartographic communities. CONCLUSION: The biggest challenge is to ensure that maps of health statistics inform without misinforming. Advances in the sciences of cartography, statistics, and visualization of spatial data are constantly expanding the toolkit available to mapmakers to meet this challenge. Asking potential users to answer questions or to talk about what they see is still the best way to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific map design. }

abstract="Maps demonstrate with a unique efficiency the distribution of phenomena in space. Maps of disease, like other types of map, convey factual information. But, by illustrating disease distributions which either change over short time-periods or vary non-randomly in space, disease maps also inevitably stimulate the formation of causal hypotheses. The earliest examples of disease mapping (medical cartography) were stimulated by the search for clues about the origins of the dreaded infections. Stevenson (1965) draws attention to several spot maps prepared in the context of yellow fever on the eastern seaboard of the United States at the end of the eighteenth century at the time of the debate between contagionists and anticontagionists. Two spot maps (Fig.1) were used by Valentine Seaman in 1798 to illustrate a paper on yellow fever in New York in 1796 and 1797. Twenty-two years later Felix Pascalis-Ouvi{\`e}re (1820) drew a careful spot map to show, yet again, the distribution of cases of yellow fever in New York, in an effort to establish causative factors. A map produced by Cartwright in 1826 of a locality, Natchez, in Mississippi, linked environmental factors closely to an epidemic of the disease. Seaman, Pascalis-Ouvi{\`e}re and Cartwright were anti-contagionists and at that time the map was, in large measure, the weapon of this faction. The extension of the epidemic, as shown on the map, was facilitated, in Cartwright's view, by `a damp climate, an eighty degree (i. e. 27 {\textdegree}C) temperature ... combined with the special effluvia of rotting pork and oysters to envelop the community in a sort of pathogenic mist. The inevitable consequence was widespread yellow fever'. Born largely of experience with yellow fever in the United States and with cholera in Europe disease mapping became relatively commonplace during the subsequent decades.",

abstract = {<p>Cartograms are a well-known technique for showing geography-related statistical information, such as population demographics and epidemiological data. The basic idea is to distort a map by resizing its regions according to a statistical parameter, but in a way that keeps the map recognizable. We deal with the problem of making continuous cartograms that strictly retain the topology of the input mesh. We compare two algorithms to solve the continuous cartogram problem. The first one uses an iterative relocation of the vertices based on scanlines. The second one is based on the Gridfit technique, which uses pixel-based distortion based on a quadtree-like data structure.</p>},

abstract = {Abstract The notion of a cartogram is reviewed. Then, based on a presentation from the 1960s, a direct and simple introduction is given to the design of a computer algorithm for the construction of contiguous value-by-area cartograms. As an example, a table of latitude/longitude to rectangular plane coordinates is included for a cartogram of the United States, along with Tissot's measures for this map projection. This is followed by a short review of the subsequent history of the subject and includes citation of algorithms proposed by others. In contrast to the usual geographic map, the most common use of cartograms is solely for the display and emphasis of a geographic distribution. A second use is in analysis, as a nomograph or problem-solving device similar in use to Mercator's projection, or in the transform-solve-invert paradigm. Recent innovations by computer scientists modify the objective and suggest variation similar to Airy's (1861) “balance of errors” idea for map projections.},

abstract = {<p>We describe <italic>bivariate cartograms</italic>, a technique specifically designed to allow for the simultaneous comparison of two geo-statistical variables. Traditional cartograms are designed to show only a single statistical variable, but in practice, it is often useful to show two variables (e.g., the total sales for two competing companies) simultaneously. We illustrate bivariate cartograms using Dorling-style cartograms, yet the technique is simple and generalizable to other cartogram types, such as contiguous cartograms, rectangular cartograms, and non-contiguous cartograms. An interactive feature makes it possible to switch between bivariate cartograms, and the traditional (monovariate) cartograms. Bivariate cartograms make it easy to find more geographic patterns and outliers in a pre-attentive way than previous approaches, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> . They are most effective for showing two variables from the same domain (e.g., population in two different years, sales for two different companies), although they can also be used for variables from different domains (e.g., population and income). We also describe a small-scale evaluation of the proposed techniques that indicates bivariate cartograms are especially effective for finding geo-statistical patterns, trends and outliers.</p>},
