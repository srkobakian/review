## Abstract

Utilising maps to present statistics has been widely used, for centuries.
Connecting the data to the geographical representation of areas that are already familiar.
It is not enough to be recognisable, if the value of the statistic cannot be seen. Cancer outcomes directly relate to the people living within a geographical area. In situations where the people are of interest, not the land they live on, it is reasonable to explore views that enhance the communication of the cancer outcomes. This has spurred innovations over the previous centuries to enhance the shapes and maps presented to effectively communicate cancer outcomes.


## Spatial Visualisation of Disease Cases

John Snow's use of a map for cholera, cases represented as blocks. Counts within region.

Plotted as points on a map, specific representation of each case.

## Spatial Visualisation of Disease Models

Driven by progressions in computing, statistical methods and collection of data.

Models summarise relationships between counts of diseases and other factors.

Choropleth Maps, relationship between regions and spatial location. Able to represent all the occurences within areas more cohesively, as total counts, or colours.
 
Urbanisation pushed people closer together, in workplaces and in homes.

Recognition of biases when utilising the geography to map people. Small areas contain more people, work towards representing regions of importance more clearly.

Cartograms stepped toward this goal by highlighting areas of interest. Made some areas bigger on the map space, kept relationship with neighbours.

Importance of the statistic in this area being communicated was more important than keeping geography recognisable.

This helps to draw attention to areas, relies on reader being able to see all areas on a map, and know the difference between initial geography and new layout given by a cartogram.

We were able to create cartograms by access to data, access to tools, greater demand for insights.

In theory these ideas have been used, but the people making them do not necessarily have not access or ability to create them.

Therefore the uptake of these maps has been due to education, not the validity of their use.

## Alternative Maps

If the goal of the map is the statistic.

If the distribution is the focus, the display should reflect that.

Replies on the idea that every area is important, no matter the size.

Recent methods have every area represented with the same map space.

This gives equal emphasis to every area, allows distributions and relationships between neighbours to become more clear.
