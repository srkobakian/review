Mapping cancer outcomes
Cartogram applications should point to examples of cancer outcomes, with the main cartogram section discussing sources considered in grey literature review. Examples of political areas may be considered if cancer data is aggregated at these levels.

Future steps should consider applications not currently utilised for cancer outcome displays, where their use may improve decision making

## Abstract

Utilising maps to present statistics has been widely used, for centuries.
Connecting the data to the geographical representation of areas that are already familiar.
It is not enough to be recognisable, if the value of the statistic cannot be seen. Cancer outcomes directly relate to the people living within a geographical area. In situations where the people are of interest, not the land they live on, it is reasonable to explore views that enhance the communication of the cancer outcomes. This has spurred innovations over the previous centuries to enhance the shapes and maps presented to effectively communicate cancer outcomes.


## Disease mapping

### Choropleth Map (Steff)

Cartographer lit, cancer atlas lit

@MACM
geographically mapping cancer mortality uses maps of europe:
Static choropleth maps, coloured from green to red, supplemented by histograms.
Introduces Moran scatterplot "In the Moran’s scatterplot, each geographic unit is represented by a point, whose X coordinate is the value of the mortality in that area and the Y coordinate is equal to the average value of the theme in the bordering areas'
And Moran's index: spatial correlation with neighbours

'visual intuition coming from the inspection of maps must be complemented and validated by rigorous statistical analyses.'
Does not acknowledge the map as a visual statistic, but a tool.

## Cartograms (Steff)

General introduction:
Cartograms stepped toward this goal by highlighting areas of interest. Made some areas bigger on the map space, kept relationship with neighbours.
USA regular cartogram (UK too)

### Contiguous
Importance of the statistic in this area being communicated was more important than keeping geography recognisable.

This helps to draw attention to areas, relies on reader being able to see all areas on a map, and know the difference between initial geography and new layout given by a cartogram.

We were able to create cartograms by access to data, access to tools, greater demand for insights.

In theory these ideas have been used, but the people making them do not necessarily have not access or ability to create them.

Therefore the uptake of these maps has been due to education, not the validity of their use.

### Non-Contiguous

Dorling (Sized according to statistic)

## Temporal displays

### Centroid displays

Plotting centroids on top of geographies. (Size is kept constant)
Hexmaps

If the goal of the map is the statistic.

If the distribution is the focus, the display should reflect that.

Replies on the idea that every area is important, no matter the size.

Recent methods have every area represented with the same map space.

This gives equal emphasis to every area, allows distributions and relationships between neighbours to become more clear.

### counts versus predictions

@SEMA
'Disease mapping is carried out to summarise spatial and spatio-temporal variation in risk.'
Decriptive statistic of the relationship between geography and a disease.
population, exposure, and health data may have pointdata or aggregated summaries (countdata)
potentially be subject to a number of inaccuracies
diagnostic error or misclassification

Not only the counts, but population, migration, deaths and births are modelled across census years.

rapid visual summary of complex geographical information, descriptive purposes, to generate hypotheses, for surveillance, and to aid policy formation and resource allocation.

When using counts:
 small populations imply large variability in estimated rates
 
Decisions taken at this stage may be critical as apparent ‘clusters’ may depend crucially on the boundaries chosen in time or space: ‘The more narrowly the underlying population is defined, the less will be the number of expected cases, the greater will be the estimate of the excess rate, and often the more pronounced will be the statistical significance’ 
 
Using prediction:
assuming that neighbouring μi are correlated leads to a ‘clustering’ prior




Driven by progressions in computing, statistical methods and collection of data.

Models summarise relationships between counts of diseases and other factors.

Choropleth Maps, relationship between regions and spatial location. Able to represent all the occurences within areas more cohesively, as total counts, or colours.


Urbanisation pushed people closer together, in workplaces and in homes.

Recognition of biases when utilising the geography to map people. Small areas contain more people, work towards representing regions of importance more clearly.
