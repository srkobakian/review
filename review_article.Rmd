Geospatial statistics have been presented and stored on maps for centuries.
Maps connect data for areas to the geographical representation which is usually familiar to the audience.
However, it is not enough for areas on maps to be recognisable, the distribution of the statistic must also be visible.
Cancer statistics directly represent and relate to the people living within individual geographical areas.
It is reasonable to explore views that enhance the communication of the cancer statistics, especially as in these situations the people are of interest, not the land they live on. 
This has spurred innovations over the previous centuries to enhance maps to effectively communicate cancer outcomes, and health outcomes more broadly.


The visualisation methods used to present cancer statistics will depend on the intended message and users of the map. 
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Presenting statistics as visualisations requires transforming individual observations into aggregations of communities as geographical units.
Visualising diseases on maps is often the first step in exploratory spatial data analysis and effectively helps in the formulation of hypotheses [@MTMSIH]. 
Disease maps help to present geographic patterns that may have been overlooked in a table, obscuring the geospatially related statistics [@SAMGIS].
By providing a visual representation of cancer outcomes, geographic patterns of disease are able to be identified and effectively addressed.
@SE recognises one of the key challenges with mapping spatial patterns of disease is the design of visualisations.
This paper addresses the visualisation techniques and their applications to cancer statistics. Highlighting the differences and historic use of these displays.
=======
Transforming statistics to visualisations takes advantage of the human visual system, which has been demonstrated to an effective communication channel for a wide range of audiences (insert munzer reference). Visualising cancer statistics enables the non-expert audience to access the outputs of complicated spatial epidemeaological analyses. These visualisation show individual observations, or observation points, aggregated into communities and geographical units.
Visualising diseases on maps is often the first step in exploratory spatial data analysis and effectively helps in the formulation of hypotheses [@MTMSIH]. 
Disease maps help to present geographic patterns that may have been overlooked in a table, obscuring the geospatially related statistics [@SAMGIS].
By providing a visual representation of cancer statistics, geographic patterns of disease are able to be identified, nvestigated further and/or effectively addressed.

## Current best practice map displays for cancer data

<!-- what is a choropleth map -->
A choropleth map is used to display the characteristics of a spatial relationship of measurements. 
A choropleth map is a true map of the topology, constructed for visual inspection of spatial patterns on a familiar geographic form. 
Figure 1 shows a choropleth map where each state of the United States of America is coloured by the average annual rate of new cases of lung and bronchus cancer from years 2012 to 2016.
Identifying and explaining spatial structures, patterns, and processes involves considering the individuals in communities and organising communities into representable units [@SAMGIS]. 
A choropleth is constructed by drawing the geographic or political boundaries, and filling the shapes with colours to represent values of a measured variable [@EI].
Early versions of choropleth maps used symbols or patterns instead of colour.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
As an alternative storage device to a table, it preserves locations for geographically ordered data, with usage dating back to the 1800s [@GOINO].
@CPISACA discuss the use of choropleths to visualise cancer data, and @DMAHP gives an overview of the development of these maps for displaying disease data.

@CPISACA discusses their use in visualising cancer data, and @DMAHP gives an overview of the development of these maps for displaying disease data.
Just as geographers are no longer the only creators of maps, @CPISACA suggests the audiences of spatial health data analysis have extended beyond researchers to the public, policymakers and the media. As such, many examples of choropleth maps are found on the websites of government, media, health and other public facing organisations (insert ref for Jessie's grey lit review).
A choropleth map is a true map of the topology, constructed for visual inspection of spatial patterns across a familiar geographic form. 
Figure 1 shows a choropleth map where each state of the United States of America is coloured by the average annual rate of new cases of lung and bronchus cancer from years 2012 to 2016.

```

<!-- psychology -->
Utilising the familiar state boundaries can make a map intuitive to read [@CIBMUK], and allow viewers to visually infer the spatial relationships in the data, i.e. how cancer rate differs across the states.
The familiarity of the geography is a worthy consideration when presenting results of spatial analysis. Just as geographers are no longer the only creators of maps, @CPISACA suggests the audiences of spatial health data analysis have extended beyond researchers to the public, policymakers and the media.
While the areas are recognisable shapes, they are often politically driven boundaries with individual areas being of non-uniform size, containing different population densities and subject to change over time. 
The different population and geographical sizes of administrative areas can attract attention to the shades of the unpopulated but large areas [@EI]. 
Choropleths can inhibit visual inference when presenting human related statistics as the display may draw attention from the 'potentially more important results in the more populous communities' [@SE]. 


<!-- Displaying of cancer data on choropleths -->
Choropleth maps can be useful devices for communicating information to public on a familiar map base.
A cancer atlas is a choropleth map, or collection of maps, representing cancer incidence and mortality for a country, or group of countries. 
In epidemiology, choropleths are often used as a tool to study the spatial distribution of cancer incidence and mortality. 
The data collection methods of cancer mortality rates across regions, and the administrative control within regions lends itself to choropleth visualisation. 
@MACM provides the definition of a cancer atlas, beginning with Haviland's maps in 1875, they attribute UK cancer atlases to Howe (1963), and early work in US cancer atlases can be attributed to Burbank (1971).
The increasing development and use of disease maps can be attributed to the availability of geographic information system software [@SE].
The choropleth maps presented levels via hatchings or dots on a black and white scale.
These atlases were key to developing hypotheses regarding areas with unusually high rates, geographic correlations, work related exposures, and high risk diets [@MACM].


<!-- Measures reported in cancer atlases -->
Almost 100 years of cancer mapping in the United States and the United Kingdom has seen increased effectiveness in the presentation cancer statistics.
Mortality rates are now often presented as relative rates of risk across the population, and age adjusted to correct for the higher prevalence of cancers in older populations.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Howe [-@HEDP] describes Stock's development of the standardised mortality ratios through the 1930s. Table \ref{tab:measures} presents summarises the measures presented in published cancer atlases, and provides a definition of each measure.

<!-- Cancer atlas literature -->

The atlas of Cancer in Queensland [@DACQ] focussed on highlighting the difference in experience for those living in rural and disadvantaged areas. They used Standardised Incidence Ratios modelled via Bayesian methods, and explored the information presented in a range of selected atlases. These atlases provided Incidence, Survival and Mortality rates to the public on Areal or Isopleth map bases.

The presentation of these rates considered not only the map base, but also appropriate choices of colour blind friendly colour schemes, and categories of the values to highlight signifcantly different areas.

### Supporting material in cancer atlases

The primary display of an atlas is often the choropleth map. The presentation of materials in atlases can also utilise bar charts, tables and scatterplots, these are useful alternative displays. They are not only used as an additional display for the cancer incidence and mortality rates, as an atlas is often supplemented with supporting statistics. When presenting cancer atlases, @MACM believes the intuition derived from maps must be 'validated by rigorous statistical analyses.' This opinion contradicts Cruickshank's (1947) as cited by @DMAHP, which discusses using visuals as 'formal statistical assessment of the spatial pattern'. @CPISACA suggests additional materials such as 'good tables, graphs, and explanatory text' support understanding and inference derived from maps, ensuring the message communicated will be consistent across a range of viewers. 
The interactivity of the more modern maps enabled supplementary information to be incorporated without cluttering the screen, such as in a tool tip feature. 

<!-- geographic hierarchies  -->
Cancer atlases are often used to describe differences between areas, they may allow statistics to be displayed at different levels of aggregation. World atlases can allow for displays of data aggregated into continents, country, states or provinces [@IARC_3].

<!-- population distribution -->
It is likely that each population area will have a different amount of people, information regarding the distribution of population levels may be provided in a table or histogram display [@NICR_1]. Atlases could also connect the population to the land available to them by communicating population density as is shown in the United States map examples.

<!-- demographics: sex, race,  -->

<!-- statistical uncertainty -->
The additional statistics often also include a measure of the statistical uncertainty of the cancer statistics presented in a choropleths. <!-- reference Aus cancer atlas DMAQ?-->


<!-- Socioeconomic Indicators -->
There may also be demographic information provided regarding each population area drawn on the maps.
This information could include a socioeconomic indicators such as unemployment, education level attained.
The areas are usually ranked and allocated to quintiles to be presented as categories describing the ranking.




## Publicly available atlases using choropleth methods

Cancer maps are effective communication tools for a general public or non-expert audience. They are commonly used in the public domain to communicate results of sophisticated statistical analyses.
The heavy use of choropleth maps within the research literature is also reflected in the types of maps that are found in the public domain.
A grey literature review of cancer atlases available in the public domain<!--(ref Jessie)--> identified 33 cancer atlases published on the internet between January 2010 and November 2015. These choropleth maps were mostly published by non-commercial organisations, including not-for-profits, government, research organisations, advocacy groups or government funded partnerships.
Only one map was published by a commercial entity. 
 
<!-- geographic coverage-->
The cancer atlases covered geographies from all around the world, but only four were global atlases. Most focussed on single nations, the United States was considered by eleven atlases, the United Kingdom by seven, followed by three of Australia, two of Canada, and one of each from Switzerland, Germany, Norway. One atlas covered the European Union.
Not all maps had a national focus and ten covered a region or state rather than an entire nation. The states or counties/regions covered were South Australia (AUS), Queensland (AUS), Ontario (CAN), Valencia (Spain), Pennsylvania county Massachusetts (US), New Hampshire (US), Cape Cod (US), Missouri (US), Florida (US), New York State (US) and Arizona (US).

### Examples of supporting statistics in public facing atlases

The atlases provided additional information to help users understand and interpret the spatial distribution presented. Table \ref{tab:supporting-stats} explores the use of these supports in a variety of online map sources. Demographics include information regarding the age and sex distribution of the areas presented. Socioeconomic indicators include Unemployment rates of regions, Remoteness and Education levels achieved. Statistical uncertainty is communicated through a Confidence (CI) interval, statistical significance levels, Boxplots, Distribution plots, and reporting the Sample Size and Standard Deviations.
These additional pieces of information can help to validate, explain or explore relationships between cancer incidence and survival rates.

<!-- geographic hierarchies  -->

<!-- population distribution -->
It is likely that each population area will have a different amount of people, information regarding the distribution of population levels may be provided in a table or histogram display [@NICR_1]. Atlases could also connect the population to the land available to them by communicating population density.


<!-- statistical uncertainty -->
These additional statistics often include a measure of the statistical uncertainty of the values of the statistics presented in a choropleth.
In the review of atlases in the public domain, atlases were considered to report uncertainty to the non-expert user if they included a measure of statistical uncertainty either within or alongside the map. The maps considered used standard and well known measures including credible intervals and standard deviation, statistical significance, box plots and distributions. The maps employing uncertainty ranged from static pdfs or infographics, to interactive online resources.
Close to half of the atlases identified (42%, n=14) included some measure of uncertainty. The most common measure used to represent uncertainty were credible or confidence intervals (CIs).

<!-- Demographics -->
Atlases often specified their use of gender in the diplays. Atlases that allowed for inteaction also allowed users to select between displays for males, females or both depending on the type of cancers explored.
<!-- Socioeconomic Indicators -->
Few atlases also explored the impact of rurality on cancer rates. 




## Cartograms as an alternative display

<!-- What is a cartogram? -->
A cartogram alters the map base with the intention of improving the presentation of the statistic of interest. For a single variable of interest, each map area is changed to emphasise the distribution by representing the corresponding value, in comparison to the value of the other areas [@ACCAC].
The changes in the map base occur by altering individual areas, by altering the shapes or boundaries.

Australia presents an extreme case of an urban rural divide. The land mass occupied by urban electoral districts is only 10% of Australia, yet 90% of the population live in these urban areas. To present election results on a choropleth map should be 'unthinkable', as it means diminishing the visual impact of majority of the electorates.
A 1966 cartogram was presented an alternative which uses mostly straight lines, and the result looks very little like the geographical shape of Australia.
This issue is felt in any nation which experiences an uneven population distribution. The United States is affect by the different densities of neighbourhoods or states. As this population distribution continues to change the need for cartograms as an alternative to a choropleth map should only increase.

<!-- There are many alternative views of the world-->
<!-- Tobler map projections-->
Choropleths may be considered true topological maps, however, if the land mass displayed covers enough of the globe, there must be a transformation or distortion to display the land in 2D. The amount of distortion is related to the distance covered by the landmass displayed @GAMP.
World map projections reflect the frequent perspectives used to view the earth. Choropleth maps will always be distorted if they cover enough of the globe, just like photographs of the globe from space. Choropleth creation requires choosing a map projection that shows a favourable distortion of the geography for presenting the set of spatial information. Selecting a display can prevent misinterpretation of global statistics, as global maps face the challenge of equitable displays of land mass on maps [@RSCW].
Maps that do not specify a projection can be considered to have some unknown projection. <!-- ??? cite tobler.-->
If the statistic presented on the map base relies on physical distance and is influenced by the topology there is no transformation needed, beyond choosing a reasonable projection. 


```{r choroCRS, fig.cap = "Four choropleth maps of the United States of America using various coordinate reference systems. Each state has been coloured according to the average age-adjusted rate of incidence for lung and bronchus for females and males in the United States 2012-2016. The map projections alter the shapes and angles of the boundaries of each state. Maps a and b are similar in their straight edges, unlike maps c and d which curve on the northern United States border. ", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ggchoroCRS.png")
```

<!-- Denominators -->

The purposeful distortion of the map space, transformed according to population density, is beneficial when a uniform density of the map base is desired. Population then becomes a uniformly distributed background for the statistic presented [@GOINO]. @ACTUC suggests 'population distribution is often extremely uneven in former British colonies', this makes the distortion necessary [@CTTMB].
When implementing a distortion of the geographical shape according to population, the resulting display is an area cartogram [@NAC], population-by-area cartogram [@TAAM], or iso-demographic map.

<!-- Why transform?-->
<!-- Common variables used to create cartograms, e.g. population, mortality -->
Cartograms provide an alternative visualisation method for statistical and geographical information.
The key difference between a choropleth and a cartogram is the desirable augmentation of the size, shape or distance of geographical areas [@ACTUC].
Cartograms may be seen as an extension of map transformations and projections. The favourable distortion is proportional to a value other other than actual earth size area [@NAC].
A disadvantage of the conventional map is that sparsely populated rural areas may be emphasized, whereas the areas representing cities are very small, making interpretation of spatial patterns very difficult.
The distortion of a cartogram accounts for the population density, preventing it from obscuring the spatial patterns [@TAAM]. 
The spatial transformation of map regions relative to the data emphasises the data distribution instead of land size [@CBATCC].
When visualising population statistics @ACTUC considers this equitable representation design 'more socially just', or honest [@NISCC], giving due attention to all members of the population and reducing the visual impact of large areas with small populations [@DMAHP]. 
@HEDP suggests that 'cancer occurs in people, not in geographical areas' and @CTTMB believe that spatial socio-economic data, like cancer rates, are best presented on a cartogram for urban areas as the population map base avoids allocating 'undue prominence' to rural areas. 
@MTMSIH encourage the use of cartograms to highlight small areas and uncover local-level inequalities. 

<!-- Overview of varieties -->
<!-- Cartogram makers -->

The creation of cartograms was historically in the hands of professional cartographers [@CD]. 
Early approaches including John Hunter and Jonathan Young (1968) and Durham's wooden tile method, Skoda and Robertson's (1972) steel ball bearing approach and Tobler's (1973) computer programs [@ACTUC]. 
Geographical information systems allowed map users, and researchers to implement their own cartograms, but these systems are utilised depending on ‘the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the map products (Nielsen 1994)’[@CD].
@HEDP discusses the impact of electronic computer-assisted techniques.


There are many alternatives to consider, the intended audience of the map, and its purpose are key points in cartogram use and creation.
@ACTUC reiterates: 'There is no "best" cartogram or method of creating cartograms just as there is no "best" map' (Monmonier and Schnell, 1988). 
There have been many algorithms presented, @SAIC provided a framework to investigate implementations and the "statistical accuracy, geographical accuracy, and topological accuracy". 



### Contiguous

<!-- What is a contiguous cartogram -->


```{r ggcont, fig.cap = "A contiguous cartogram map of the United States of America. Each state has been coloured according to the average age-adjusted rate of incidence for lung and bronchus for females and males in the United States 2012-2016. Each stated shape has been distorted according to the population of the state in 2015. The state of California has become much larger due to it's large population density. This draws attention to the densely populated North East region, and detracts from the Mid West.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ggcont.png")
```

<!-- Intentionally preserve neighbours -->

A contiguous cartogram maintains connectivity of the map regions while areas are resized according to a statistic. This transformation often occurs at the expense of the shape of areas [@CBATCC, @NAC, @TAAM].
From a computer graphics perspective, @ACA explain the application of 'map deformation' to account for the value assigned to each area, they provide three methods for creating value-by-area cartograms.
Examples include Tobler’s Pseudo-Cartogram Method, Dorling’s Cellular Automaton Method [-@ACTUC], Radial Expansion Method of Selvin et al., Rubber Sheet Method of Dougenik et al., Gusein-Zade and Tikunov’s Line Integral Method, Constraint-Based Method (Kocmoud and House) [-@CBATCC].



An intentional goal when creating the 1966 Census population cartogram for Canada was to maintain contiguity, while attempting to keep the actual shape of places. The end result was a 'very accurate isodemo-graphic map of Canada'. This intentional design goal coincided with the rising interest in urban geography and presentation of social statistics. 


To be able to recognise the significant changes, a reader will usually have to know the initial geography to find the differences in the new cartogram layout [@NAC]. Tobler's Conformal mapping means to preserve angles
locally so that the shapes of small areas on a traditional map and a cartogram would be similar.
@CBATCC presents this issue as conflicting tasks or aims, to adjust region sizes and retain region shapes. 
@MDAC define the term 'mosaic cartograms' for hexagonal tile displays, where the amount of tiles for each area can be used to communicate the statistic of regions. 
The complexity of the boundaries can be adjusted in the resulting display, as the size of the tiles used allows a trade-off be made between boundary complexity and simplicity.


<!--
Tobler's method and the many implementations that 'elaborated' on it are derived from 'numerical approximations to a pair of equations'[@ACTUC]. They all operate through incremental adjustments, and can produce wildly different outcomes from small changes in the inputs.
 
Computer generated map examples:  @HEDP
(Hopps et al. 1968; Armstrong 1972). There
has followed a flood of disease atlases, mainly concentrating on the modem problems of cancer and degenerative diseases from countries as scattered as the United States (Burbank 1971; Mason et al. 1975, 1976; Pickle et al. 1987), the Soviet Union (Levin 1980), Japan (Shigematsu 1977), the Federal Republic of Germany
-->


### Non-Contiguous

Non-Contiguous cartograms succeed in maintaing the shape of the areas presented.
Each area stays in a similar position to their location on a choropleth map. The choropleth map base is often also plotted as a comparison point to highlight the change in area. The addition is the gap between areas, created as each individual area shrinks or grows according the associated value of the statistic. @NAC discusses creation of these maps, the significance of the empty areas left between the geographic boundaries and the new shape, and the 'degree of difference from the original map that is the real message' of these displays.

As the trade-off regarding boundaries approaches simplicity, the distortion of region shapes on the contiguous cartogram presents an additional hurdle to visual recognition and this hurdle is not only eliminated on the noncontiguous cartogram but is replaced by the meaningful empty-space property [@NAC, @ECGC].
The shapes are valuable for recognition and allows users to orient themselves on the display. Map creators can efficiently communicate with this kind of map by keeping the outlines or particular elements of the original in the new shape [@NISCC].
The scale of the areas does not impact on the shape recognition. However it may impact on the visibility of all areas if small areas expand beyond their boundaries.

Each state has been coloured according to the average age-adjusted rate of incidence for lung and bronchus for females and males in the United States 2012-2016. Each state shape has been maintained, but the size has altered according to the population of the state in 2015. The state of California has remained closer to it's original size than it's surrounding states. The North East states have remained closer to their geographical size, in the case of Massachusetts and Connecticut. This draws attention to the densely populated North East region, and the sparse Mid West.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}

### Alternative Displays

Daniel Dorling presented an alternative to highlight the spatial distribution and neighbourhood relationships without complex distortions of borders and boundaries. This approach opposes preserving the intricate shape details.
This concept is founded in the simple question put forward by Daniel Dorling -@ACTUC:

>"If, for instance, it is desirable that areas on a map have boundaries which are as simple as possible, why not draw the areas as simple shapes in the first place?"

He answers this with his implementation of maps created with 'the simplest of all shapes'. He acknowledged the sophistication of contiguous cartograms but critiqued their 'very complex shapes'.
Circular cartograms use the same simple shapes for every region represented, and size the shapes according to the statistic represented or the population for a base map. This familar shape may be more effective for understanding the spatial distribution than contiguous cartograms, as the 'nonsense' shapes used have 'no meaning' after distortions are applied @NISCC.
To produce a compelling map, a gravity model is applied to avoid overlaps, and keep spatial relationships with neighbouring areas over many iterations. This implementation can work for up to 'one hundred thousand' areas.
 
```{r ggdorl, fig.cap = "A dorling cartogram of the Unites States of America. Each state has been coloured according to the average age-adjusted rate of incidence for lung and bronchus for females and males in the United States 2012-2016. Each state has been represented by a circle, but the size was determined by the population of the state in 2015. The North East states remain closer to their neighbours, and may be displaced from their geographic location. The sparsity of the population in the Mid West is highlight by the distance between the circles, located at the geographic centroids.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ggdorl.png")
```

The groundwork for the simplistic approach had been laid in the mid 1930's be Raisz. @TFYCC quotes the official definition of Value-Area Cartograms, the simplistic displays which represent each area as a single rectangle, sized according to the value of the statistic.
This rectangluar display also allows for tiling, where geographic neighbours also share rectangle borders. 



# A critique of mapping methods

>"designing a map tailored to precise goals [is] easier than forcing a single map to accommodate diverse objectives" @CPISACA

Waldo Tobler [-@TVSSS] explores many graphical techniques, and suggests there are particular methods for particular purposes. To choose an appropriate map display, the map creator must consider the intended user, and message the map will communicate.
It is the objectives of the investigator that will drive the choice of representation [@CPISACA]. 

There are two keys presented by @SAMGIS to drive the choice of display: 
 - the properties of the visualisation, and 
 - the ease or accuracy of information extraction for map users

# Animation and Interactivity

Recent developments in technology allowed interactive web atlases.

>"Where control of the message is important, static maps will continue to be the most effective, although good tables, graphs, and explanatory text are still needed in order to ensure that different people will see the same thing in the maps" @CPISACA

The intention of interactivity and animation is to allow users to answer their own questions.

## counts versus predictions

@SEMA
'Disease mapping is carried out to summarise spatial and spatio-temporal variation in risk.'
Descriptive statistic of the relationship between geography and a disease.
population, exposure, and health data may have point data or aggregated summaries (count data)
potentially be subject to a number of inaccuracies
diagnostic error or misclassification

Not only the counts, but population, migration, deaths and births are modelled across census years.

rapid visual summary of complex geographical information, descriptive purposes, to generate hypotheses, for surveillance, and to aid policy formation and resource allocation.

When using counts:
 small populations imply large variability in estimated rates
 
Decisions taken at this stage may be critical as apparent ‘clusters’ may depend crucially on the boundaries chosen in time or space: ‘The more narrowly the underlying population is defined, the less will be the number of expected cases, the greater will be the estimate of the excess rate, and often the more pronounced will be the statistical significance’ 
 
Using prediction:
assuming that neighbouring μi are correlated leads to a ‘clustering’ prior
