Description:  
Reviews  are  comprehensive  analyses  of  specific topics. ACE emphasizes that an acceptable Review Article  should  not  be  a  ‘book  chapter’  generally  covering  a  topic,  but  should  be  a  focused  application  of  literature  to  address  a  relevant  clinical  issue.  The  Editors  submit  them  upon  invitation.  Proposals  for  reviews  may  be  submitted;  however, in this case authors should only send an outline of the  proposed  paper  for  initial  consideration.  Both  solicited  and  unsolicited  review  articles  will  undergo  peer  review  prior  to  acceptance. 
Systematic  review  with  no  meta-analytics  in  ACE  is  addressed  as  Review  Article.
Review  Articles  should  entail  a  section  describing  the  contribution  of each author to the manuscript. See section “AUTHORS’ CONTRIBUTION’ for details.
